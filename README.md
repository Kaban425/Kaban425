# Hello! I'm Dmitry 👋

Welcome to my corner on GitHub! I'm a second-year student from Russia, passionate about cybersecurity, network security, and programming.

### 🚀 About Me

* 🔭 I'm currently delving into **penetration testing (pentesting)** and exploring the exciting world of **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions. I've already started my journey with **Kali Linux** and am eager to expand my practical skills.
* 🌱 I'm actively learning more about **network security** and aiming to deepen my understanding of programming, especially in **C++**. I'm also familiar with database fundamentals, including setting up basic databases using **pgAdmin 4**.
* 👯 I'm looking for collaborations on **cybersecurity challenges, CTF exercises, and programming projects**, particularly those involving C++ or network security. I'm especially interested in teaming up for CTFs – I can bring the strategic thinking, and I'd love to partner with someone (or an AI assistant like you!) for the coding implementation.
* 💬 Ask me about **basic C++ programming, fundamental database concepts, initial steps in Kali Linux, or anything related to cybersecurity for beginners**. I also have a keen interest in **modeling in oil refining and coking chemistry**, which is part of my academic project.
* ⚡ Fun Fact: When I'm not learning about network protocols or writing code, you might find me strategizing in **Dota 2**!
